Tutorial and examples of how to use the QGIS geometry generator

## What is the QGIS geometry generator

**From QGIS documentation**
The geometry generator symbol layer allows to use expression syntax to generate
a geometry on the fly during the rendering process. The resulting geometry does
not have to match with the original geometry type and you can add several
differently modified symbol layers on top of each other.
